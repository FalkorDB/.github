FalkorBD is the first queryable [Property Graph](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc) database to use [sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) to represent the [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) in graphs and [linear algebra](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html) to query the graph.

Primary features:
* Adopting the [Property Graph Model](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc)
  * Nodes (vertices) and Relationships (edges) that may have attributes
  * Nodes can have multiple labels
  * Relationships have a relationship type
* Graphs represented as sparse adjacency matrices
* [OpenCypher](http://www.opencypher.org/) with proprietary extensions as a query language
  * Queries are translated into linear algebra expressions
